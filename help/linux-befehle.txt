lprm -Plp2 1234                   # delete job 1234 on lp2
ls - Show lists of files or information on the files
ls file     # does the file exist?
ls -l file  # show information about the file
ls *.txt    # show all files ending in .txt
ls -lt      # show information about all files in date order
ls -lrt     # above reversed in order
ls -a       # show all files including hidden files
ls dir      # show contents of directory
ls -d dir   # does the directory exist?

man grep     # get help on grep
man -s1 sort # show documentation on sort in section 1
more - Show a file one screen at a time
more file                # show file one screen at a time
grep 'frog' file | more  # Do it to output of other command
mv - Move file(s) or rename a file
mv file1 file2                     # rename file1 to file2
mv dir1 dir2                       # rename directory dir1 to dir2
mv file1 file2 file3 ... directory # move files into directory
nano - very simple text editor. Warning - this program can introduce extra line breaks in your file if the screen is too narrow!
nice - Start a process in a nice way. Nice levels run from -19 (high priority) to 19 (low priority). Jobs with a higher priority get more CPU time. See renice for more detail. You should probably be using the grid-engine to run long jobs.
nice +19 myjob1   # run at lowest priority
nice +8 myjob2    # run at lowish priority
openoffice.org - a free office suite available for Linux/Unix, Windows and Mac OS X.
passwd - change your password
pine - A commonly used text-based mail client. It is now called alpine. Allows you to send and receive emails. Configuration options allow it to become quite powerful. Other alternatives for mail are mozilla mail and mutt, however I suggest you stick to alpine or thunderbird.
printenv - Print an environment variable in tcsh
setenv MYVARIABLE Fred
printenv MYVARIABLE
printenv # print all variables
ps - List processes on system
> ps -u jss          # list jss's processes
  934 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
^^^^^ ^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^
PID   output   CPU time name
> ps -f      # list processes started here in full format
> ps -AF     # list all processes in extra full format
> ps -A -l            # list all processes in long format
> ps -A | grep tcsh   # list all tcsh processes
pwd - Show current working directory
> pwd
/home/jss/writing/lecture
quota - Shows you how much disk space you have left
> quota -v
...
renice - Renice a running process. Make a process interact better with other processes on the system (see top to see how it is doing). Nice levels run from -19 (high priority) to 19 (low priority). Only your own processes can be niced and they can only be niced in the positive direction (unless you are root). Normal processes start at nice 0.
> ps -u jss | grep bigprocess      # look for bigprocess
 1234 pts/0    99:00:00 bigprocess
> renice 19 1234                   # renice PID 1234 to 19
rm - Delete (remove) files
rm file1     # delete a file (use -i to ask whether sure)
rm -r dir1   # delete a directory and everything in it (CARE!)
rm -rf dir1  # like above, but don't ask if we have a -i alias
rmdir - Delete a directory if it is empty (rm -r dirname is useful if it is not empty)
rmdir dirname
staroffice - An office suite providing word processor, spreadsheet, drawing package. See Users' Guide on how to install this. This is a commercial version of the openoffice office package - use openoffice.org on linux.
setenv - Set an environment variable in tcsh.
setenv MYVARIABLE Fred
echo Hi there $MYVARIABLE
tar - Combine files into one larger archive file, or extract files from that archive (same as gtar on Linux).
tar cvf /dev/rmt/0 ./      # backup cwd into tape
tar tvf /dev/rmt/0         # list contents of tape
tar xvf /dev/rmt/0         # extract contents of tape
thunderbird - Start mozilla thunderbird.
top - Interactively show you the ``top'' processes on a system - the ones consuming the most computing (CPU) time. Press the ``q'' key in top to exit. Press the ``k'' key to kill a particular process. Press ``r'' to renice a process.
